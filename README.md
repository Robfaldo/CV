I'm an ex-technology recruiter who got tired of wishing I was doing the roles that I was recruiting for! I've just completed Makers Academy immersive web development bootcamp and I'm looking for a junior backend end or full stack development role. I'd love to join a team that practices TDD, and while language/framework isn't the most important thing to me I've got experience with Javascript (NodeJS & Express) and Ruby (Rails, Sinatra). I enjoy TDD, OO programming, refactoring, debugging and that sweet, satisfying feeling of solving a difficult technical problem.

## Technical experience

Through my team projects, I've had experience using Agile methodologies such as XP, sprints and Kanbans. I wrote a[ blog](https://blog.makersacademy.com/what-i-learnt-from-my-first-group-coding-project-at-makers-academy-2cebad45b210) on my experience following my first project!

## Education

#### Makers Academy (May '18 to August '18)

I decided to invest the £8,000 tuition fee to join Makers Academy which is a full time, immersive, web development bootcamp based in London. They focus on full stack development (using mainly Ruby & Javascript) and have taught me about TDD, SOLID principles, DRY, Agile development, pair programming and XP Values. The coach team is currently made up of developers who've had careers at Facebook, Softwire, HSBC, Ministry of Justice and more.

Since I've been at Makers, I've seen recent graduates been hired by Deloitte, Pottermore (for you Harry Potter fans!), Hive Learning, Tesco, ITV, Capco, Mettrr and so many more!

#### Online courses

I started to learn to develop about 6 months before Makers and used a lot of the introductory online courses (CodeAcademy, Coursera, Udacity and the likes). Aside from those, a couple that I feel worth mentioning:
* Codeacademy, partnering with thoughtbot - [TDD with Javascript intensive](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/test-driven-development)
* [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). Harvards introduction to computer science, made available for free by edX (partially complete, submitting passing work up to problem set 4, of 8). I wanted to get a grounding and familiarity with some of the fundamentals of computer science. I learnt C and explored Algorithms, Data Structures, Pointers, HTTP and more. [Syllabus](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/syllabus.html)

#### Nottingham Trent University (2009 to 2012)

- Law (LLB)
- 2.1

## Non-technical experience

**Oasis HR** (Nov '17 to May '18)    
*Internal Recruiter (part-time contract)*\
After deciding to career change and moving back to the UK, I was rehired by Oasis HR on a part-time contract. During this time I spent about 1-2 days a week learning to code.<br>
Highlights:
* I partnered with 4 directors on a 6 months project to hire 2 senior recruiters to join their team. We revamped their employer branding and saved over £18k in agency fees.__Teamwork, Stakeholder engagement, Project management__

**Bloomberg LP (New York, US based)** (Aug '16 to Sept '17)   
*Experienced Hire Technical Recruiter*\
After relocating to our New York HQ, I was the first recruiter dedicated to hiring Site Reliability Engineers for Bloombergs' 5,000 strong developer team.<br>
Highlights:
* Worked with heads of groups (application and infrastructure teams) on identifying a matrix of core technical and non-technical requirements for SRE's across different teams (different teams had very different opinions!). __Project management, Stakeholder engagement, Teamwork__
* I got the chance to work with some great leaders across multiple engineering groups and delved a lot deeper into DevOps, Production, Systems, Reliability and Development in order to understand the relationship between each and the very ambiguous world of site reliability engineering. __Research, Teamwork, Stakeholder engagement__

**Bloomberg LP (London, UK based)** (Jan '15 Aug '16)   
*EMEA Campus Technical Recruiter*\
Before relocating to New York, I worked in our London office recruiting for our C++ software development programme, aimed mainly at CS students.<br>
Highlights:
* I ran our hackathon sponsorship for events across Europe and attended about 10 that year myself. It was at one in Glasgow that I first tried coding (Python through team treehouse!). __Project management, Teamwork__
* I love data and I looked after our teams data reporting. I automated our monthly data report and used .csv exports from our applicant tracking system to draw insights and build predictive funnels. When I first decided to learn programming seriously, I thought it would be to do data analysis (I did an amazing Python course through Coursera with the University of Toronto). It wasn't until I got deeper into programming that I realised I found full stack engineering more interesting. __Data manipulation__
* One of my proudest achievements in my career was running a multi university coding challenge across the top universities in the UK. It took 6 months and many sleepless nights but resulted in over 1,000 contestants, 27 in-person events (26 qualifiers and a global final in our offices). We hired two tier 1 candidates from Oxford as a result, including the 2nd place finals finisher. I got to present the journey to the global HR team and it was selected to represent Bloomberg as 1 of 3 HR initiatives for an HR award competition Bloomberg entered. Here’s a video we made of the finals https://goo.gl/bw2k2j. __Project management, Teamwork, Stakeholder engagement, Programme design__

**Oasis HR** (May '13 to Jan '15)   
*Recruitment Consultant*\
Agency recruiter in a specialist HR recruitment consultancy, recruiting mid to senior level roles in a variety of industries for SME and blue-chip organisations. I made placements at Bloomberg, AOL, CGI Group, Blinkbox, Harrods, BBC and more! __Project management, Determination__

## Interests

I love to be outside and enjoy everything from hiking trails, camping trips, skiing &amp; snowboarding to skydiving and hang gliding. I've been running the last couple of years and completed the 2018 Spartan Race.

I love psychology and philosophy and can often be found reading something about how our minds work!
