## Your Name

After 5 years working in recruitment, I decided it was time to do something completely different with my life. After a lot of soul-searching, conversations and research I decided to become a full stack engineer. I'm so glad I made that decision and now after a few months of self study before joining a 3 month intensive coding course with Makers Academy, I'm looking for my first role as a software developer.

## Experience

**Oasis HR** (Nov '17 to May '18)    
**Internal Recruiter (part-time contract)** 
After deciding to career change and moving back to the UK, I went back to Oasis HR on a part time contract. I helped build out their employer brand and hired for their own team of recruitment consultants, hiring 2 great people and saving around Â£9,000 on agency fees. I spent about 1-2 days a week learning programming - I wanted to make sure I enjoyed the realities of software development as a career!  

**Bloomberg LP (New York, US based)** (Aug '16 to Sept '17)   
**Experienced Hire Technical Recruiter**
For most of my time in New York I solely focused on hiring our site reliability engineers. I was the first dedicated in-house recruiter for SRE's and despite many teams hiring for them, there was little cohesion across the groups. A big part of my role was sourcing and attracting SRE's, and another big part was working with the individual groups hiring them to build out a Bloomberg SRE profile by identifying the skills, experience and personal qualities needed to be successful. 

I got the chance to work with some great leaders across multiple product groups and delve a lot deeper into DevOps, Production, Systems, Reliability and Programming in order to understand the relationship between each and the very ambigious world of site reliability engineering. I think it was here that I realised how much I enjoyed learning about production software! 

**Bloomberg LP (New York, US based)** (Jan '15 Aug '16)   
**EMEA Campus Technical Recruiter**
Before relocating to New York, I worked in our London office recruiting for our C++ software development programme, aimed mainly at CS students.

I ran our hackathon sponsorship for events across Europe and attended about 10 that year myself. It was at one in Glasgow that I first tried coding (Python through team treehouse!).

I love data and I looked after our teams data reporting. I automated our monthly data report and used .csv exports from our applicant tracking system to draw insights and build predictive funnels. When I first decided to learn programming seriously, I thought it would be to do data analysis (I did an amazing Python course through Coursera with University of Toronto). It wasn't until I got deeper into programming that I realised I found full stack engineering more interesting. 

**Oasis HR** (May '13 to Jan '15)   
**Recruitment Consultant**  
Agency recruiter in a specialist HR recruitment consultancy, recruiting
mid to senior level roles in a variety of industries for SME and blue-chip organisations. I made placements at Bloomberg, AOL, CGI Group, Blinkbox, Harrods, BBC and more! 

## Interests 

I love to be outside and enjoy everything from hiking trails, camping trips, skiing &amp; snowboarding to skydiving and hang gliding. I've been running the last couple of years and completed the 2018 Spartan Race. 

I'm fascinated by psychology and the unconscious mind. Whilst in New York I decided to pursue a life-long curiousity by enrolling in an Eriksonian Hypnotherapy course. I completed the 6 day training and the following test and coursework to become certified. 

After a long hiatus, I've got back into reading. I've been tackling some of the classics recently.
